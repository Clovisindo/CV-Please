When a new applicant arrives, You can click in your computer(center) and open Job Offer and CV panels information.
You can click in each option to ask something to the applicant, evaluate each response in order to validate their application, think always in the best decision for the companies.
Also You can click in the applicant, to activate the cross question mode, and ask question about two terms( a requisite from the job offer and a skill from the CV), It's usually effective in getting them to tell the truth.

Some information can't be used to ask question, like previous jobs, you 'll see interactive options move when you put your mouse on it.
 
Although salary information is shown, today's requests will not discuss those topics.
Every question you ask takes time, and we will evaluate you based on your performance, both in time and results.

Once you have a clear decision, You can click in the company computer( the one in your left) and accept or decline the applicant.

When you finish with all the applicants, click in the \"End day\" button ( top right) to follow with another day.
